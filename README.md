# DE-Final-Pitop-Project
Repo for Digital Electronics final project 

This project is meant to be a detection system which will send an alert when the outside conditions are too high or too low. At first when it is turned on it will be in an idle state where it is on but it is not actively monitoring the area around it. Then when a button is pressed it will enter an "active" state. The active state is meant as a transitional state for one to enter in their desired control values, being the light control, the sound control and their respective ranges. Once all the values have been inputted the device will then enter a "set" state. In the set state it is actively monitoring the area around it with a light and sound sensor and displaying a reading for both. If the button to switch the device from idle to active is pressed again during the set state the device will go back to being idle. When the sensor detects either the light or the sound value going outside the range it enters an "alert" state. During the alert state the device releases an alarm indicating that one of the values is outside the range. However if both of the sensors detect that the light and sound are both within the desired range again it will re enter the set state from the alert state. Lastly if the button is pressed during the alert state it will automatically reset everything and go back to the idle state
